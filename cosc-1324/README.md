# üçè Applied Analytics

__Completed Semester 2, 2019__

This course covered fundamental statistical concepts and modern statistical practice. We studied statistical data investigations, summary statistics, data visualisation and probability as a measure for uncertainty. We built upon these topics and learn about sampling, sampling distributions and confidence intervals as the basis for statistical inference. The course finished with a series of modules looking at common hypothesis testing methods for different types of data. There was an emphasis on conceptual understanding, interpretation of statistical output and the use of statistical technology, namely R, for statistical computation.
