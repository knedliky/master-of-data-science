### Problem Statement
As a fertiliser company I want to be able to know which specific areas in the Proserpine region are consistently underperforming (in relation to health index) over a number of growth cycles so that I may be able to proactively engage with the farmers who may seek additional fertilisers. For the identified problem areas, I wish to consider the various possible reasons for the lack of yield such as rainfall, or some other fertility factor. This would allow me to predict the success in offering a fertiliser solution.
