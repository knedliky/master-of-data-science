How to create a distribution of AusCopHub. 

1. Ensure that you have fetched and committed everything which needs to go in.
2. Change the version number in the auscophub/__init__.py. Version number
   is of the form a.b.c, as discussed below. 
   Update the release notes page doc/source/releasenotes.rst, by going 
   through the change logs since the last release, and noting what 
   has been done. 
   DON'T FORGET TO COMMIT THESE, BEFORE THE NEXT STEP!!!!
3. Push the changes with "git push"
4. Check out a clean copy of the repository into some temp directory
   and cd into it. 
5. Create a distribution tarball, using
     python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar,zip
   This createsw a tar.gz and a zip file in the dist/ subdirectory
6. Go to https://github.com/CopernicusAustralasia/auscophub/releases
   and create a new release by pressing "Draft a new release".
   You should fill in the following:
      Tag version: A.B.C
      Release title: Version A.B.C
      Upload files: Add the tar.gz and zip files created in step 5
      Click "Publish release"


Version Numbers.
The AusCopHub version number is structured as A.B.C, following the Semantic 
Versioning conventions, outlined at https://semver.org. In simple terms, 
- The A number should change for major alterations, most particularly those 
  which break backward compatability, or which involve major restructuring of 
  code or data structures. 
- The B number should change for introduction of significant new features
- The C number should change for bug fixes or very minor changes.
