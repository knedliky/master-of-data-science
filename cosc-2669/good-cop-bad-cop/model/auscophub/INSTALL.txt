A standard Python setup.py script is provided. 

Use the command 
    python setup.py install
to install in standard locations (/usr/local/bin). To nominate non-standard locations,
use the --prefix option, e.g.
    python setup.py install --prefix=~/auscophub

If using a non-standard prefix directory, then the prefix/bin/ subdirectory needs to be 
in your $PATH, and the prefix/lib/pythonX.X/site-packages/ directory needs to be in 
your $PYTHONPATH
