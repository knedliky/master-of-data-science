"""
Functions for interface to the SARA client API. 

These routines can be used to build client-side applications for searching and 
downloading data. 

The most obvious way to use these routines is as follows::

    urlOpener = saraclient.makeUrlOpener()
    sentinel = 2
    paramList = ['startDate=2017-05-01', 'completionDate=2017-05-31']
    results = saraclient.searchSara(urlOpener, sentinel, paramList)

This would return a list of multi-level dictionary objects created from the JSON output 
of the server, one for each matching zipfile. The paramList can be any of the parameters which
the SARA API accepts, these are passed straight through to the API. 

The default SARA server is hard-wired in this module. However, the server name, and the protocol
to be used, can both be over-ridden using the following environment variables
    | AUSCOPHUB_SARA_PROTOCOL (default https)
    | AUSCOPHUB_SARA_SERVERHOST (default copernicus.nci.org.au)

    Each name/value pair is added to a HTTP GET URL as a separate name=value

    The overall effect of multiple name/value pairs is that each one further 
    restricts the results, in other words they are being AND-ed together. Note 
    that this is not because of the '&' in the constructed URL, that is just the 
    URL separator character. This means that there is no mechanism for doing an 
    OR of multiple search conditions.
