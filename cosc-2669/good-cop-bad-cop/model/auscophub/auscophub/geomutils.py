"""
Some utility functions for handling the geometries given with Sentinel files. 

ESA have done a fairly minimal job with their footprint geometries. The routines in this
file are mostly aimed at providing a bit more support beyond that, mostly for things like
crossing the International Date Line. 

It is assumed that we have access to the GDAL/OGR library, and numpy. 

Note on efficiency. 
------------------
These routines all operate on the basic ogr.Geometry object. However, since this is 
a relatively opaque structure, mostly they will convert to JSON strings and
use those to get hold of the coordinates. This means there is a fair bit of
converting back and forth, which means we are not at maximum efficiency. There is also
quite a bit of changing of projection. However, in the context of AusCopHub, this is 
all somewhat negligible compared to doing things like reading and copying ESA zip files.
