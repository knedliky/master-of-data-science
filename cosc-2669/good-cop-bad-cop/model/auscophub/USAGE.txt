Server Side
-----------
Current the only main program is auscophub_storeSenZipfile.py. It is used to move
one or more SAFE-format zipfiles into their final home, and create associated
XML and PNG files. 

It takes a --help option, to give full commandline help. 

For moving one file, normal usage would be something like
    auscophub_storeSenZipfile.py --storagetopdir /some/directory S2A_OPER_PRD_MSIL1C_PDMC_20160407T190635_R116_V20160406T001844_20160406T002213.zip
This would move the given zipfile into a directory structure under /some/directory, with
directory levels for year/year-month/gridCellName/
where the grid cell name is a readable label for a 5 degree lat/long grid cell. In this particular 
case, it would be
    /some/directory/2016/2016-04/20S145E-25S150E/

The input zipfile name can include its full path. 

It can also be used to move a large list of zipfiles. These are placed in a text file, one 
zipfile per line, and this text file name is given to the --zipfilelist option, e.g.
    auscophub_storeSenZipfile.py --storagetopdir /some/directory --zipfilelist ziplist.txt

Note the options for testing, and unusual cases:
    --dummy         Do nothing, just report
    --verbose       Report what is happening, as it happens
    --copy          Instead of moving the zipfile, copy it to its final location, 
                    leaving the original untouched
    --symlink       Instead of moving the zipfile, just create a symbolic
                    link from the final location to the original file. 
    --xmlonly       Create the XML files in final location, but do not move
                    the zipfile, or create the PNG file. Useful when updating the
                    format of the XML file. 


Client Side
-----------
One main program is provided, for simple searching of the server, based on date and region. 
    auscophub_searchZipfiles.py
It takes a --help option, to give full commandline help. 

Two main Python modules are provided. The most important one is 
    auscophub.client
This contains routines useful routines to manage connecting to the server and searching
the available files. The routines within this form the basis of auscophub_searchZipfiles.py. 

The other is 
    auscophub.auscophubmeta
and is a small class which reads the XML file provided for each zipfile, by AusCopHub. Each of 
these contains simple metadata to assist in searching. This facility is used within the
client code above.
