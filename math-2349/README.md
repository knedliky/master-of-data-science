# 🏢 Data Wrangling

_Completed Semester 1, 2020_

The course covered a wide range of topics designed to equip us with the skills needed to prepare all forms of untidy data for statistical analysis. Throughout the course, core concepts of data wrangling (a.k.a. data preprocessing) were introduced namely tidy data, data integration, data cleaning, data transformation, data standardisation, data discretisation, and data reduction. Data preprocessing skills were developed and applied to complex, noisy, and inconsistent real-world data using leading open-source software, R.
